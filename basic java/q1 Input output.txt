Input / Output in Java
In this challenge, you will learn to read input for the first time. The most popular way to read input in java is by using Scanner.

For example:

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
int myInt = scanner.nextInt();
For printing it

System.out.println( myInt);
The code above creates a Scanner object named scanner and uses it to read an integer. It prints output using System.out.println(MyInt). 
So, if our input is:

5
Our code will print:

5

In this challenge, you must read 3 integers and then print them. Each integer must be printed on a new line.

Input Format
There are 3 lines of input, and each line contains a single integer.

Output Format
